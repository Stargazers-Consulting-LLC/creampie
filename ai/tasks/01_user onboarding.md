# User Onboarding Process

## Overview

This document outlines the user signup and onboarding process for our application. The process is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient while collecting necessary information to provide a personalized experience.

## Signup Flow

### 1. Initial Access

- Users can access the signup page through:
  - Direct URL navigation
  - "Sign Up" button in the navigation bar
  - Call-to-action buttons on the landing page

### 2. Registration Form

The registration form should collect the following information:

- Email address (required)
- - The email address _is_ your username.
- Password (required)
  - Must meet security requirements (minimum 12 characters, no restriction on numbers or special characters)
- First Name (required)
- Last Name (required)

### 3. Email Verification

- After form submission:
  1. Send verification email to the provided address
  2. Display success message with instructions to check email
  3. User must click verification link to activate account
  4. Verification link expires after 72 hours
  5. `is_verified` flag is set to true upon successful verification
- Users are let into the app immediately and have until the 72 hours expire as a grace period.

### 4. Account Setup

After email verification, users will be guided through:

- Optional two-factor authentication setup
  - Can be enabled later through account settings
  - Requires setting up `two_factor_secret`

### 5. Welcome Experience

- Display welcome message

## Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting for signup attempts
- Use CAPTCHA for bot prevention
- Secure password storage using industry-standard hashing
- Implement proper session management using `AppUserSession` model
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Support for two-factor authentication
- Password reset functionality using `password_reset_token` and `password_reset_expires`

## Session Management

- Each login creates a new `AppUserSession` record
- Sessions include:
  - IP address
  - User agent
  - Device ID (optional)
  - Location data (optional)
  - Platform and browser information
  - Expiration time
  - Last activity timestamp
- Sessions can be revoked if needed
- Multiple active sessions allowed per user

## Error Handling

- Clear error messages for:
  - Invalid email format
  - Password requirements not met
  - Username already taken
  - Network issues
  - Server errors
  - Session expiration
  - Two-factor authentication failures

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use JWT for authentication
- Implement proper form validation
- Create responsive design for all devices
- Implement proper error logging
- Handle session management according to `AppUserSession` model

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

- Enhanced session management features
- Additional two-factor authentication methods
- Advanced user preferences management
- A/B testing different onboarding flows
- Enhanced security features
