# Historical Stock Data Retrieval

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and implementation details for retrieving historical stock data from external sources. The system will support fetching historical price data, volume, and other market indicators for stocks across different time periods.

Users will be able to track a symbol that they're interested in, which will be updated periodically (likely daily).

The primary external source will be Yahoo Finance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Data Retrieval

   - Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance via the requests module
   - - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{symbol}/history/
   - Retrieve all relevant data
   - - Open,High,Low,Close,Adj Close,Volume
   - Support technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI)

2. Data Validation

   - Verify data completeness of each row before loading it into our database.

3. Error Handling
   - Manage connection timeouts
   - Process errors gracefully
   - Implement retry mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### Data Sources

1. Primary Data Source: Yahoo Finance
   - No API key required
   - Limited to daily and above intervals
   - Good for historical data

### Error Handling

1. Rate Limiting

   - Implement token bucket algorithm
   - Queue requests when limit reached
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

2. Data Validation
   - Check for missing data points
   - Verify volume consistency

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. Data retrieval functions
2. Data validation logic
3. Error handling
4. Caching mechanism

### Integration Tests

1. API endpoint testing
2. Data source integration
3. Cache integration
4. Rate limiting
