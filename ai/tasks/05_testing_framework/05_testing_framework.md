# Testing Framework Implementation

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing framework for the Cream API to ensure reliability, maintainability, and code quality.

## Requirements

### 1. Test Structure

- Create a `tests` directory at the root level
- Organize tests to mirror the application structure
- Implement both unit and integration tests
- Use pytest as the testing framework

### 2. Test Categories

#### Authentication Tests

```python
# tests/auth/test_signup.py
def test_signup_success():
    """Test successful user registration"""
    pass

def test_signup_duplicate_email():
    """Test registration with existing email"""
    pass

def test_signup_invalid_email():
    """Test registration with invalid email format"""
    pass

def test_signup_password_requirements():
    """Test password validation requirements"""
    pass
```

#### User Management Tests

```python
# tests/users/test_user_management.py
def test_user_profile_update():
    """Test user profile updates"""
    pass

def test_user_deactivation():
    """Test user account deactivation"""
    pass

def test_user_verification():
    """Test email verification process"""
    pass
```

#### Database Tests

```python
# tests/db/test_database.py
def test_database_connection():
    """Test database connectivity"""
    pass

def test_database_migrations():
    """Test database migrations"""
    pass

def test_database_rollback():
    """Test transaction rollback"""
    pass
```

### 3. Test Configuration

#### Fixtures

- Create reusable fixtures for:
  - Database sessions
  - Test users
  - Authentication tokens
  - Mock external services

#### Environment Setup

- Use pytest-env for environment variables
- Implement test-specific configuration
- Use separate test database

### 4. Test Coverage

- Implement coverage reporting
- Target between 70% and 80% code coverage
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases

### 5. CI Integration

- Add test execution to CI pipeline
- Configure test reporting
- Set up coverage reporting

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Testing Infrastructure**

   - Install required packages:
     ```toml
     [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
     pytest = "^8.4.0"
     pytest-asyncio = "^1.0.0"
     pytest-cov = "^4.1.0"
     pytest-env = "^1.1.3"
     ```
   - Create test configuration files
   - Set up test database

2. **Create Base Test Classes**

   - Implement test database session management
   - Create authentication helpers
   - Set up common fixtures

3. **Implement Core Tests**

   - Authentication flows
   - User management
   - Database operations
   - API endpoints

4. **Add Integration Tests**

   - End-to-end flows
   - External service integration
   - Error handling

5. **Configure CI Pipeline**
   - Add test execution steps
   - Configure coverage reporting
   - Set up test artifacts

## Success Criteria

- All critical paths have test coverage
- Tests pass consistently in CI
- Coverage reports show >80% coverage
- Tests are maintainable and readable
- Test execution time is reasonable

## Dependencies

- pytest
- pytest-asyncio
- pytest-cov
- pytest-env
- Test database (PostgreSQL)

## Timeline

- Setup: 1 day
- Core Tests: 2-3 days
- Integration Tests: 2-3 days
- CI Integration: 1 day
- Total: 6-8 days
