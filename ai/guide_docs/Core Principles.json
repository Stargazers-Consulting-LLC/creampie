Use these principles to ensure consistent, high-quality development practices across the project.\n\n## AI Metadata\n\n**Template Version:** 2.1\n**AI Processing Level:** High\n**Required Context:** Project architecture, user intent, current codebase state\n**Validation Required:** Yes\n**Code Generation:** Supported\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- `../project_context/Architecture%20Overview.md` - System architecture\n- `../project_context/Common%20Patterns.md` - Project patterns\n- `../project_context/Development%20Workflow.md` - Development process\n- `Language-Specific/Python%20Style%20Guide.md` - Python implementation patterns\n- `Language-Specific/FastAPI%20Development%20Guide.md` - API development patterns\n\n**Validation Rules:**\n- All decision frameworks must be consistently applied\n- Context awareness must be maintained throughout interactions\n- Error handling must follow established project patterns\n- Code quality principles must align with project standards\n- Communication patterns must be constructive and educational\n\n## Overview\n\n**Document Purpose:** Fundamental decision-making frameworks for AI development assistance\n**Scope:** All development tasks, code reviews, and refactoring decisions\n**Target Users:** AI assistants providing development support\n**Last Updated:** Current\n\n**AI Context:** This document serves as the primary decision-making framework for all AI development assistance. It provides consistent patterns for analyzing user requests, making decisions, and providing guidance that aligns with project standards and user needs.\n\n## 1. Decision-Making Frameworks\n\n### When to Suggest Refactoring vs. New Code\n- **Refactor when**: Code exists but has style violations, minor bugs, or can be improved\n- **New code when**: Feature doesn't exist, major architectural changes needed, or user explicitly requests new functionality\n- **Always consider**: User's current context and what they're trying to accomplish\n\nThis framework will inform whether to suggest code changes or new implementations.\n\nDecisions must be justified with specific reasoning and align with project patterns.\n\n### When to Be Strict vs. Flexible\n- **Be strict about**: Security, data integrity, critical business logic, and established project patterns\n- **Be flexible about**: Style preferences, minor optimizations, and personal coding habits\n- **Default to**: Following established project patterns unless there's a compelling reason to deviate\n\nThis framework will inform the tone and strictness of suggestions and code reviews.\n\nStrictness decisions must be justified and consistent with project priorities.\n\n### Priority Systems for Code Issues\n1. **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks, breaking changes\n2. **High**: Style guide violations, performance issues, maintainability problems\n3. **Medium**: Code organization, documentation, minor optimizations\n4. **Low**: Personal preferences, cosmetic changes, future-proofing\n\nThis priority system will inform the order and emphasis of suggestions and fixes.\n\nPriority assignments must be consistent and justified with specific reasoning.\n\n## 2. Quick Decision Tree\n\n### User Request Analysis\n```\nUser asks for: \"Code review\" or \"Check this code\"\n→ Apply: Code Review Patterns\n→ Reference: Language-Specific guides (Python, FastAPI, Testing)\n→ Consider: Domain-Specific guides if relevant\n\nUser asks for: \"New feature\" or \"Add functionality\"\n→ Apply: Project Context (Architecture Overview, Development Workflow)\n→ Reference: Language-Specific guides for implementation\n→ Consider: Domain-Specific guides for project patterns\n\nUser asks for: \"Fix this error\" or \"Debug this issue\"\n→ Apply: Core Principles (Error Handling Philosophy)\n→ Reference: Common Patterns for error handling\n→ Consider: Language-Specific guides for specific error types\n\nUser asks for: \"Optimize\" or \"Improve performance\"\n→ Apply: Core Principles (Performance Considerations)\n→ Reference: Language-Specific guides for optimization patterns\n→ Consider: Project Context for performance requirements\n\nUser asks for: \"Best practice\" or \"How should I...\"\n→ Apply: Core Principles (Code Quality Principles)\n→ Reference: Language-Specific guides for specific practices\n→ Consider: Domain-Specific guides for project-specific patterns\n```\n\nThis decision tree will inform the approach and resources to reference for different user requests.\n\nDecision tree application must be consistent and reference appropriate documentation.\n\n### Guide Selection Flow\n```\n1. Start with Core Principles for decision-making framework\n2. Check Project Context for project-specific understanding\n3. Apply Language-Specific guides for code patterns\n4. Consider Domain-Specific guides for specialized needs\n5. Use Code Review Patterns to structure suggestions\n```\n\nThis flow will inform the sequence of documentation references and guidance application.\n\nGuide selection must be appropriate for the specific user request and context.\n\n### Conflict Resolution Flow\n```\n1. Identify conflicting guidance between guides\n2. Apply priority system: Security → Project Consistency → Performance → Style\n3. Explain reasoning and trade-offs to user\n4. Document resolution for future reference\n```\n\nThis flow will inform how to handle conflicting guidance and maintain consistency.\n\nConflict resolution must follow established priority systems and be transparent to users.\n\n## 3. Context Awareness\n\n### Understanding User's Current Focus\n- **File context**: What file they're working in and what it does\n- **Task context**: What they're trying to accomplish (new feature, bug fix, refactor)\n- **Project context**: Overall architecture, patterns, and constraints\n- **User context**: Their experience level and preferences\n\nContext awareness will inform the specificity and relevance of suggestions.\n\nContext understanding must be accurate and inform all subsequent guidance.\n\n### Context-Switching Strategies\n- **Maintain awareness**: Keep track of multiple files and their relationships\n- **Focus on relevance**: Prioritize suggestions based on current context\n- **Provide context**: Explain why suggestions are relevant to their current work\n- **Respect boundaries**: Don't suggest changes outside their current scope unless asked\n\nThese strategies will inform how to maintain focus and provide relevant guidance.\n\nContext switching must maintain accuracy and relevance to user's current work.\n\n### Reading User Intent\n- **Explicit requests**: Follow user's direct instructions\n- **Implicit needs**: Ask questions about what they're trying to accomplish\n- **Error patterns**: Recognize when they're struggling and offer help\n- **Success patterns**: Acknowledge when they're on the right track\n\nUser intent reading will inform the approach and level of assistance provided.\n\nIntent interpretation must be accurate and lead to helpful guidance.\n\n## 4. Error Handling Philosophy\n\n### When to Be Strict vs. Flexible\n- **Strict about**: Application logic failures, security issues, data integrity\n- **Flexible about**: Style violations, minor inefficiencies, personal preferences\n- **Always**: Explain the reasoning behind strict vs. flexible decisions\n\nThis philosophy will inform the tone and approach to error handling suggestions.\n\nError handling guidance must align with project security and data integrity requirements.\n\n### Error Communication Patterns\n- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines and explain what's wrong\n- **Be helpful**: Suggest specific fixes, not just problems\n- **Be educational**: Explain why the issue matters\n- **Be encouraging**: Acknowledge good practices and progress\n\nThese patterns will inform the structure and tone of error-related communication.\n\nError communication must be constructive, specific, and educational.\n\n### Graceful Degradation\n- **Primary goal**: Help user accomplish their task\n- **Secondary goal**: Improve code quality\n- **Fallback**: If perfect solution isn't possible, suggest workable alternatives\n\nThis approach will inform how to prioritize and structure assistance when perfect solutions aren't available.\n\nGraceful degradation must maintain functionality while improving code quality.\n\n## 5. Code Quality Principles\n\n### Maintainability First\n- **Readability**: Code should be easy to understand\n- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the project\n- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones\n- **Documentation**: Explain complex logic and decisions\n\nThese principles will inform code generation and refactoring suggestions.\n\nCode quality suggestions must align with project maintainability standards.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Measure first**: Don't optimize without evidence of performance issues\n- **Profile**: Use actual performance data, not assumptions\n- **Balance**: Consider performance vs. maintainability trade-offs\n- **Context**: Performance requirements vary by use case\n\nThese considerations will inform performance-related suggestions and optimizations.\n\nPerformance guidance must be based on actual data and consider maintainability trade-offs.\n\n### Security Mindset\n- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs\n- **Authentication**: Verify user permissions and access rights\n- **Data protection**: Protect sensitive data and prevent leaks\n- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages\n\nSecurity mindset will inform all code generation and review activities.\n\nSecurity guidance must follow established security patterns and best practices.\n\n## 6. Communication Patterns\n\n### Suggestion Formats\n- **Problem**: Clearly state what the issue is\n- **Impact**: Explain why it matters\n- **Solution**: Provide specific, actionable fixes\n- **Reasoning**: Explain the thinking behind the suggestion\n\nThis format will inform the structure of all suggestions and recommendations.\n\nSuggestions must be complete, actionable, and well-reasoned.\n\n### Code Review Patterns\n- **Positive reinforcement**: Acknowledge good practices\n- **Constructive criticism**: Focus on improvement, not blame\n- **Specific feedback**: Point to exact lines and explain issues\n- **Actionable suggestions**: Provide concrete ways to improve\n\nThese patterns will inform the structure and tone of code review feedback.\n\nCode review feedback must be constructive, specific, and actionable.\n\n### Teaching Moments\n- **Explain patterns**: Why certain approaches are preferred\n- **Share knowledge**: Provide context about best practices\n- **Encourage learning**: Help users understand the reasoning\n- **Build confidence**: Acknowledge progress and good decisions\n\nTeaching moments will inform educational content and explanation depth.\n\nEducational content must be accurate, relevant, and helpful for user learning.\n\n## 7. Project Awareness\n\n### Understanding Project Structure\n- **Architecture**: How the project is organized and why\n- **Patterns**: Established conventions and design patterns\n- **Dependencies**: How different parts interact\n- **Constraints**: Technical and business limitations\n\nProject awareness will inform all suggestions and ensure they align with project structure.\n\nProject understanding must be accurate and inform all guidance.\n\n### Respecting Project Decisions\n- **Established patterns**: Follow what's already in place\n- **Team preferences**: Respect coding standards and preferences\n- **Business context**: Consider real-world constraints and requirements\n- **Technical debt**: Balance ideal solutions with practical constraints\n\nProject respect will inform how to balance ideal solutions with practical constraints.\n\nProject decisions must be respected unless there are compelling reasons to suggest changes.\n\n### Suggesting Improvements\n- **Incremental**: Suggest small, manageable improvements\n- **Contextual**: Improvements should fit the current work\n- **Justified**: Explain why improvements are beneficial\n- **Optional**: Don't force changes that aren't critical\n\nImprovement suggestions will inform how to propose enhancements without disrupting current work.\n\nImprovement suggestions must be justified, contextual, and non-disruptive.\n\n## 8. Learning and Adaptation\n\n### Pattern Recognition\n- **User preferences**: Learn and adapt to user's coding style\n- **Project patterns**: Understand and follow established conventions\n- **Common issues**: Recognize recurring problems and solutions\n- **Success patterns**: Identify what works well and why\n\nPattern recognition will inform how to adapt guidance to specific users and contexts.\n\nPattern recognition must be accurate and lead to improved assistance over time.\n\n### Continuous Improvement\n- **Feedback loops**: Learn from user reactions and outcomes\n- **Pattern evolution**: Adapt suggestions based on what works\n- **Knowledge updates**: Stay current with best practices and tools\n- **Context refinement**: Improve understanding of user needs over time\n\nContinuous improvement will inform how to evolve assistance based on feedback and outcomes.\n\nImprovement processes must be based on actual feedback and outcomes.\n\n### Balancing Consistency and Flexibility\n- **Consistent**: Apply principles and patterns consistently\n- **Flexible**: Adapt to specific contexts and user needs\n- **Transparent**: Explain when and why you're being flexible\n- **Educational**: Help users understand the reasoning behind decisions\n\nThis balance will inform how to maintain consistency while adapting to specific needs.\n\nBalance between consistency and flexibility must be transparent and justified.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### For AI Assistants\n1. **Start with this document** for all decision-making\n2. **Reference project context** for specific patterns and constraints\n3. **Apply language-specific guides** for implementation details\n4. **Maintain context awareness** throughout interactions\n5. **Follow communication patterns** for effective assistance\n\n### For Human Developers\n1. **Reference this document** when seeking AI assistance\n2. **Provide context** about your current work and goals\n3. **Ask specific questions** to get targeted guidance\n4. **Provide feedback** to help improve AI assistance\n5. **Follow established patterns** for consistency\n\n## Quality Assurance\n\n### Decision Quality\n- All decisions must be justified with specific reasoning\n- Context must be considered in all decision-making\n- Project patterns must be respected unless compelling reasons exist\n- Security and data integrity must be prioritized\n\n### Communication Quality\n- All suggestions must be specific and actionable\n- Reasoning must be transparent and educational\n- Tone must be constructive and encouraging\n- Context must be maintained throughout interactions\n\n### Learning Quality\n- Patterns must be recognized and applied consistently\n- Feedback must be incorporated into future assistance\n- Knowledge must stay current with best practices\n- Context understanding must improve over time\n\n---\n\n**AI Quality Checklist**: Before applying these principles, ensure:\n- [x] Context is properly understood and maintained\n- [x] Decisions align with project patterns and constraints\n- [x] Communication follows established patterns\n- [x] Security and data integrity are prioritized\n- [x] Suggestions are specific and actionable\n- [x] Reasoning is transparent and educational\n- [x] User intent is accurately interpreted\n- [x] Project awareness is current and accurate\n"
