## Overview

**Feature Name:** Stock Tracking Request UI
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** Medium
**Target Release:** Sprint 3

**AI Context:** This section establishes the feature identity and scope. Use consistent naming conventions from existing features.

## Description

This feature will allow authenticated users to request that the system track specific stocks on their behalf. All backend logic will be contained within the `cream_api/stock_data` module, following the established project patterns.

**AI Guidance**: Be specific about what the feature does, who uses it, and what problem it solves. Reference existing features for similar patterns.

**Code Generation Hint**: This description should inform the implementation plan and user stories.

## Business Value

- **User Engagement**: Increases user interaction with the platform by allowing them to request stock tracking
- **Data Coverage**: Expands the range of stocks being tracked based on user demand
- **User Satisfaction**: Provides users with control over which stocks are monitored
- **Platform Growth**: Encourages users to return to check on their requested stocks

**AI Guidance**: Connect to existing business goals. Reference similar features' impact if applicable.

**Validation**: Each benefit should be measurable or observable.

## User Stories

- As a **registered user**, I want to **request that a specific stock be tracked** so that **I can monitor stocks I'm interested in**
- As a **registered user**, I want to **see confirmation when my request is processed** so that **I know the system is working on my request**
- As an **admin user**, I want to **view all tracked stocks and their status** so that **I can manage the tracking system**
- As an **admin user**, I want to **deactivate tracking for specific stocks** so that **I can control system resources**

**AI Guidance**: Use existing user types from the system. Make stories specific and testable.

**Code Generation Hint**: These stories will inform the user experience flow and acceptance criteria.

**Validation**: Each story should be testable and have clear acceptance criteria.

## Architecture Analysis

Based on the current project structure:
- **Backend**: All stock-related logic in `cream_api/stock_data/` module
- **Models**: Stock models in `cream_api/stock_data/models.py` (TrackedStock model)
- **API**: Endpoints defined in `cream_api/stock_data/api.py`, router in `cream_api/main.py`
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with shadcn/ui components in `cream_ui/src/`

**AI Guidance**: Reference actual files and modules from the codebase. Use `../project_context/Architecture%20Overview.md` for context.

**Code Generation Hint**: This analysis will determine which files need to be created or modified.

**Validation**: All listed files and modules must exist in the codebase.

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Stock Request Creation**: Users can submit stock symbol requests with validation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: System prevents tracking the same stock multiple times
- **Request Confirmation**: Users receive immediate feedback on request status
- **Admin Management**: Admins can view and manage all tracked stocks
- **Integration with Existing Pipeline**: New requests integrate with existing stock data processing

**AI Guidance**: Make requirements specific enough that they can be implemented and tested. Reference existing patterns.

**Code Generation Hint**: These requirements will become test cases and implementation tasks.

**Validation**: Each requirement must have clear acceptance criteria.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: API response time < 200ms for stock request submission
- **Security**: Rate limiting of 10 requests/minute per user, input sanitization for stock symbols
- **Scalability**: Support 100 concurrent stock request submissions
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing authentication system and protected routes

**AI Guidance**: Use measurable, specific requirements. Reference existing performance patterns.

**Code Generation Hint**: These requirements will inform technical considerations and testing strategy.

**Validation**: All requirements must be measurable or verifiable.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### Update `cream_api/stock_data/models.py`
No new models needed - use existing `TrackedStock` model:

- **TrackedStock Model**: Already exists and tracks stocks globally
  - Fields: `id: int, symbol: str, last_pull_date: datetime, last_pull_status: str, error_message: str, is_active: bool`
  - Unique constraint on symbol (prevents duplicate tracking)
  - **Purpose**: Track which stocks are being monitored by the system
  - **Relationships**: No new relationships needed

**AI Guidance**: Reference existing models for field patterns. Use consistent naming conventions.

**Code Generation Hint**: This will become the actual SQLAlchemy model definition.

**Validation**: Field types must match existing patterns, relationships must be valid.

**Note**: The existing `TrackedStock` model is sufficient for our use case. When a user requests a stock:
1. If the stock is already being tracked (exists in TrackedStock), the request is approved immediately
2. If the stock is not being tracked, create a new TrackedStock entry and approve the request
3. All users benefit from stocks being tracked, regardless of who requested them

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### A. Models
- No changes needed to existing `TrackedStock` model
- Use existing model with fields: `id`, `symbol`, `last_pull_date`, `last_pull_status`, `error_message`, `is_active`

**Code Generation Hint**: Reference existing model patterns for consistency.

#### B. Schemas
- **StockRequestCreate**: `symbol: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=10, regex=r'^[A-Z]+$')`
- **StockRequestResponse**: Based on TrackedStock model with fields: `id`, `symbol`, `is_active`, `last_pull_date`
- Include validation for symbol format (uppercase letters only) and length (1-10 characters)

**Code Generation Hint**: This will become the actual Pydantic schema definition.

#### C. Business Logic
- `def process_stock_request(symbol: str, user_id: int) -> TrackedStock:` - Process user stock request
- `def get_tracked_stocks() -> List[TrackedStock]:` - Get all tracked stocks (admin only)
- `def deactivate_stock_tracking(symbol: str) -> TrackedStock:` - Deactivate tracking (admin only)
- Reference existing patterns from `cream_api/stock_data/` module

**Code Generation Hint**: These will become the actual function implementations.

#### D. Error Handling
- `StockAlreadyTrackedError` - When stock is already being tracked
- `InvalidStockSymbolError` - When symbol format is invalid
- `StockNotFoundError` - When stock doesn't exist in external API
- Reference existing error patterns from `cream_api/common/exceptions.py`

**Code Generation Hint**: These will become exception class definitions.

#### E. Background Tasks
- No additional tasks needed - use existing `update_all_tracked_stocks()` from `cream_api/stock_data/tasks.py`
- Existing `run_periodic_updates()` automatically picks up new TrackedStock entries

**Code Generation Hint**: These will become Celery task definitions.

### 3. API Integration

#### A. Router Integration
- No changes needed to `cream_api/main.py` - stock data router already imported
- Add new endpoints to existing `cream_api/stock_data/api.py`
- Reference existing endpoint patterns like `/stock-data/track`

**Code Generation Hint**: This will become router registration code.

#### B. Endpoint Implementation
- `POST /stock-data/request` - Submit stock tracking request (requires auth)
- `GET /stock-data/tracked` - List all tracked stocks (admin only)
- `PATCH /stock-data/tracked/{symbol}/deactivate` - Deactivate tracking (admin only)
- Include specific request/response formats with field names
- List specific auth requirements: `@requires_auth` for user endpoints, `@requires_admin` for admin endpoints

**Code Generation Hint**: These will become FastAPI endpoint definitions.

### 4. Frontend Implementation

#### A. API Client Functions
- `trackStock(symbol: string): Promise<TrackedStock>` - Request to track new stock
- `getTrackedStocks(): Promise<TrackedStock[]>` - Get all tracked stocks (admin only)
- `deactivateTracking(symbol: string): Promise<TrackedStock>` - Deactivate tracking (admin only)
- Include specific TypeScript interfaces with field names

**Code Generation Hint**: This will become the actual TypeScript API client code.

#### B. Pages
- **StockRequestPage**: `cream_ui/src/pages/stock-requests/StockRequestPage.tsx`
- Describe specific form fields: stock symbol input with validation, submit button, loading state, success/error messages

**Code Generation Hint**: This will become the React component implementation.

#### C. Components
- **StockRequestForm**: `cream_ui/src/components/stock-requests/StockRequestForm.tsx` with props: `onSubmit: (symbol: string) => void`
- **StockSymbolInput**: `cream_ui/src/components/stock-requests/StockSymbolInput.tsx` with validation
- **MessageDisplay**: `cream_ui/src/components/stock-requests/MessageDisplay.tsx` for success/error messages

**Code Generation Hint**: This will become the React component with props interface.

### 5. User Experience Flow

#### A. Primary User Flow
1. User navigates to `/stock-requests` page
2. User sees form with stock symbol input field
3. User enters stock symbol (validation: 1-10 uppercase letters)
4. User clicks "Track Stock" button
5. Form shows loading state during submission
6. If successful, shows confirmation message with stock symbol
7. If stock already tracked, shows "already being tracked" message
8. If error, shows error message with details

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform the component state management and routing.

#### B. Alternative Flows (if applicable)
1. Invalid symbol shows error message with validation rules
2. Admin sees additional management options in admin dashboard
3. Network error shows retry option with fallback message

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform error handling and conditional rendering.

### 6. Integration Points

#### A. Existing Systems
- Integrates with `cream_api/stock_data/` module using existing `TrackedStock` model
- References existing functions: `update_all_tracked_stocks()` for background processing
- Uses existing authentication system from `cream_api/users/`

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform import statements and function calls.

#### B. External Dependencies
- No new external dependencies required
- Uses existing stock data retrieval system
- Leverages existing authentication and authorization

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform requirements.txt and package.json updates.

#### C. Background Processing
- Uses existing `run_periodic_updates()` task from `cream_api/stock_data/tasks.py`
- No additional task scheduling needed
- References existing task patterns

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform Celery task definitions and scheduling.

## Technical Considerations

### A. Security
- Input sanitization for stock symbols (uppercase letters only)
- Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per user
- Admin-only access for management endpoints
- Reference existing security patterns from `cream_api/common/`

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform input validation and security middleware.

### B. Performance
- Simple form submission with minimal data processing
- Database indexing on symbol field for fast lookups
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reference existing performance patterns

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform database migrations and query optimizations.

### C. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of invalid stock symbols with clear error messages
- Network timeout retry logic for API calls
- Fallback states for network issues
- Reference existing error handling patterns

**Code Generation Hint**: This will inform try-catch blocks and error recovery code.
