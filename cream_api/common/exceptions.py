"""Custom exceptions for the cream_api package.

This module provides a hierarchy of custom exceptions used throughout the
cream_api package. It includes base exceptions for general errors and
specific exceptions for stock data operations, validation failures, and
not found scenarios.

The exception hierarchy follows a logical structure from general to specific,
allowing for proper error handling and categorization throughout the application.
