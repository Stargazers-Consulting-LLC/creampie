Cash Rules Everything Around Me Project: Investing in Everyone

CREAMPIE is a radical experiment in development, AI tooling and personal finance. A truly open source platform for financial planning.

Most Americans can't cover an emergency expense and that's bullshit.

It's also a crass joke, because i thought it was funny at the time.

## Truly Open

When I say open source, I mean it: **Everything**, from the source code to the math, is documented.

Audit the code or run it yourself.

## Investing in EVERYONE

From simple tools like savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit to complex instruments like options trading.

## Better AI Tooling

If this is the future we're getting then so be it. Learn from my experiences in the ai folder and curse better.
