This folder is made for humans.

I wrote this readme, and as far as I know, Cursor has never tried to touch it.

This was sort of intended as a buffer between the ai/ folder and human readable tasks. Turns out it's way easier to read a markdown file than dense clouds of json. Right now it's kind of an overblown Issue Tracker.

The only real thing of interest here is the tasks directory, which contains the complete plan for the stock tracking portion of the app. There used to be "STOCK-010-deployment-plans" or something in the integration folder, which I removed. This code is barely ready for github. There's no way I'm deploying it.
