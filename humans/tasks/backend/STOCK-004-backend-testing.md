## Description
Implement comprehensive testing for all backend components of the stock tracking feature.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Write unit tests for existing Pydantic schemas
- [x] Write unit tests for existing business logic functions
- [x] Write integration tests for existing API endpoints
- [x] Test error handling and edge cases
- [x] Test authentication and authorization
- [x] Test database operations and transactions
- [x] Write tests for new schemas and business logic functions
- [x] Achieve minimum 80% test coverage

## Technical Details
**Test Files:**
- `tests/stock_data/test_schemas.py` ✅ (Enhanced with additional validation tests)
- `tests/stock_data/test_services.py` ✅ (Enhanced with error handling tests)
- `tests/stock_data/test_api.py` ✅ (Enhanced with admin endpoint tests)

**Test Categories:**
- Unit tests for individual functions ✅
- Integration tests for API endpoints ✅
- Error handling tests ✅
- Authentication tests ✅
- Database transaction tests ✅
- Edge case validation tests ✅

**Requirements:**
- Use existing pytest patterns ✅
- Use existing test fixtures ✅
- Mock external dependencies ✅
- Test both success and failure scenarios ✅

## Dependencies
- STOCK-001 (Pydantic schemas) ✅
- STOCK-002 (Business logic) ✅
- STOCK-003 (API endpoints) ✅

## Definition of Done
- [x] All tests are written and passing
- [x] Test coverage meets minimum requirements
- [x] Error scenarios are properly tested
- [x] Tests follow existing patterns
- [x] CI/CD pipeline passes all tests

## Notes
Focus on testing edge cases and error conditions. Ensure tests are maintainable and readable.

## Progress Summary
- **Enhanced test_services.py**: Added comprehensive error handling tests for database operations, commit failures, and rollback scenarios
- **Enhanced test_api.py**: Added tests for admin endpoints (currently disabled), error handling for all endpoints, and authentication scenarios
- **Enhanced test_schemas.py**: Added edge case validation tests for symbol format validation, including whitespace handling, length validation, and character validation
- **Coverage Improvements**: Significantly improved test coverage for error handling paths and edge cases across all modules
