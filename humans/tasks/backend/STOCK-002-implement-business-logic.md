## Description
Implement core business logic functions for processing stock tracking requests and managing tracked stocks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Basic stock tracking logic exists in API endpoint
- [x] Implement `process_stock_request()` function
- [x] Implement `get_tracked_stocks()` function for admin access
- [x] Implement `deactivate_stock_tracking()` function
- [x] Add proper error handling and validation
- [x] Include comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Handle duplicate stock requests gracefully
- [x] Follow existing async/await patterns

## Technical Details
**File:** `cream_api/stock_data/services.py`

**Key Functions:**
- `process_stock_request(symbol: str, user_id: str, db: AsyncSession) -> TrackedStock`
- `get_tracked_stocks(db: AsyncSession) -> List[TrackedStock]`
- `deactivate_stock_tracking(symbol: str, db: AsyncSession) -> TrackedStock`

**Requirements:**
- Use existing SQLAlchemy patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Add structured logging
- Handle edge cases (duplicates, invalid symbols)

## Dependencies
- STOCK-001 (Pydantic schemas)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All business logic functions are implemented
- [x] Error handling is comprehensive
- [x] Logging is properly implemented
- [x] Edge cases are handled correctly
- [x] Unit tests are written and passing
- [x] Code follows existing patterns

## Notes
Focus on reusability and maintainability. Consider future enhancements when designing the functions.

## Implementation Summary
- Created `cream_api/stock_data/services.py` with core business logic functions
- Added custom exceptions in `cream_api/common/exceptions.py`
- Refactored API endpoint to use business logic service
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation
- Added structured logging throughout
- Handles duplicate requests gracefully (returns existing tracking)
- Disabled stocks remain disabled (no automatic reactivation)
- Follows existing async/await and SQLAlchemy patterns
- Fixed all test issues and updated tests to match new behavior
