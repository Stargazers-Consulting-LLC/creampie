## Description
Add new API endpoints for requesting stock tracking and managing tracked stocks.


## Before Resuming Work:
- [ ] Are there unused imports?
- [ ] Are the legal notices correct?
- [ ] Can we move anything into a module level constants file?
- [ ] Are there constants in the tests that should be moved?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add `POST /stock-data/track` endpoint for requesting stock tracking
- [ ] Add `GET /stock-data/tracked` endpoint for listing tracked stocks (admin)
- [ ] Add `DELETE /stock-data/tracked/{symbol}` endpoint for deactivating tracking (admin)
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add request/response validation using Pydantic schemas
- [ ] Include proper error handling and status codes
- [ ] Add API documentation with examples

## Technical Details
**File:** `cream_api/stock_data/api.py`

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /stock-data/track` - Request stock tracking âœ…
- `GET /stock-data/tracked` - List all tracked stocks (admin only)
- `DELETE /stock-data/tracked/{symbol}` - Deactivate tracking (admin only)

**Requirements:**
- Use existing FastAPI patterns
- Implement proper authentication
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include API documentation
- Follow existing endpoint structure

## Dependencies
- STOCK-001 (Pydantic schemas)
- STOCK-002 (Business logic)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All endpoints are implemented and working
- [ ] Authentication is properly configured
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] API documentation is complete
- [ ] Integration tests are written and passing
- [ ] Endpoints follow existing patterns

## Notes
Ensure proper separation of concerns between API layer and business logic layer.
