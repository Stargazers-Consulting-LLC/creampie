## Description
Implement comprehensive testing for all frontend components of the stock tracking feature.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Write unit tests for API client functions
- [x] Write component tests for StockRequestForm
- [x] Write component tests for TrackedStocksPage
- [x] Test form validation and error handling
- [x] Test API integration and error states
- [x] Test user interactions and state changes
- [x] Achieve minimum 80% test coverage

## Technical Details
**Test Files:**
- `cream_ui/src/lib/api/__tests__/stockTracking.test.ts` ✅ **COMPLETED**
- `cream_ui/src/components/stock-tracking/__tests__/StockRequestForm.test.tsx` ✅ **COMPLETED**
- `cream_ui/src/pages/admin/__tests__/TrackedStocksPage.test.tsx` ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Test Categories:**
- Unit tests for API client functions ✅ **15 tests covering all API functions**
- Component rendering tests ✅ **Comprehensive rendering tests for all components**
- User interaction tests ✅ **Form submission, validation, state changes**
- Form validation tests ✅ **Required fields, format validation, error handling**
- Error handling tests ✅ **API errors, network errors, validation errors**

**Requirements:**
- Use Jest and React Testing Library ✅ **Using Vitest and React Testing Library**
- Mock API calls appropriately ✅ **All API calls properly mocked**
- Test user interactions ✅ **Form interactions, button clicks, state changes**
- Test error scenarios ✅ **Comprehensive error handling coverage**
- Follow existing test patterns ✅ **Consistent with project patterns**

## Dependencies
- STOCK-005 (API client functions) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- STOCK-006 (Stock request form) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- STOCK-007 (Tracked stocks page) ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Definition of Done
- [x] All tests are written and passing
- [x] Test coverage meets minimum requirements
- [x] User interactions are properly tested
- [x] Error scenarios are covered
- [x] Tests follow existing patterns

## Summary of Work Completed
✅ **API Client Tests**: 15 comprehensive tests covering all stock tracking API functions including trackStock, getTrackedStocks, deactivateStockTracking, isValidStockSymbol, getErrorMessage, and authentication headers.

✅ **StockRequestForm Tests**: 16 comprehensive tests covering form rendering, validation (required fields, symbol format, length), user interactions (auto-uppercase, form submission), loading states, error handling (API errors, network errors), success callbacks, form clearing, and accessibility.

✅ **TrackedStocksPage Tests**: 16 comprehensive tests covering loading states, data display (table format, empty states), API integration, error handling, user interactions (refresh, deactivation), confirmation dialogs, status indicators, date formatting, and responsive behavior.

✅ **Test Coverage**: All components have excellent test coverage with comprehensive scenarios including happy paths, error cases, edge cases, and user interactions.

✅ **Test Quality**: All tests follow project patterns, use proper mocking, test user interactions realistically, and provide good error coverage.

## Notes
All frontend testing for the stock tracking feature has been completed successfully. The tests are comprehensive, maintainable, and provide excellent coverage of user interactions and error handling scenarios.
